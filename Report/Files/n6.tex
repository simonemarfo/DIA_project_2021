\subparagraph*{Problem explaination}
The problem requires to find the optimal prices for the two items and to optimize the assignment of the promos, in the scenario where all the parameters need to be learnt.
\subparagraph*{Strategy}
We simulate the random arrival of the customers. For every customer we retrieve a superarm from the Thompson sampling learner. A superarm is associated to the couple of the candidates prices of the two items. We evaluate the purchase of the first item at the suggested price. In case the customer buys the first item, we pull the matching from the UCB learner, and we do the same procedure of purchase for the second item at the proposal discounted price. Before the arrival of a new customer, we update the TS learner with the entire reward given by the two items, and the UCB learner with the reward of the second item. We have used the same two matrixes in the same way of the previous request.
