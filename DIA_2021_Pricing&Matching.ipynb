    "Provide a mathematical formulation of the problem in the case in which the daily optimization is performed using the average number of customers per class. Provide an algorithm to find the optimal solution in the offline case in which all the parameters are known. Then, during the day when customers arrive, the shop uses a randomized approach to assure that a fraction of the customers of a given class gets a specified promo according to the optimal solution. For instance, at the optimal solution, a specific fraction of the customers of the first class gets P0, another fraction P1, and so on. These fractions will be used as probabilities during the day.\n"
